# Live-Subtitle
ANDROID APP that can RECOGNIZE LIVE AUDIO/VIDEO STREAMING (powered by free Android Developers Speech Recognition API) then TRANSLATE (powered by MLKIT TRANSLATE) and display them as SUBTITLES.

This app has PROS & CONS compared to other Speech Recognition APIs like VOSK, IBM WATSON, and PREMIUM GOOGPLE SPEECH API

PROS:
It's FREE and supports all languages supported by Google with very good accuracy

CONS:
It currently can only listen if you PLAY YOUTUBE STREAM (NOT ALL STREAMS!) via ANDROID VLC PLAYER

For LOCAL VIDEOS on your STORAGE, you need ES MEDIA PLAYER (by installing ES FILE EXPLORER) or FX MEDIA PLAYER (by installing FX FILE MANAGER)
