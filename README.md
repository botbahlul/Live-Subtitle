# Live-Subtitle
ANDROID APP that will RECOGNIZE words of LIVE AUDIO/VIDEO STREAMING then TRANSLATE and display it as SUBTITLES

This app has PROS & CONS compared to another Speech Recognition Framework like VOSK, IBM WATSON, and PREMIUM GOOGPLE SPEECH API

PROS:
It's FREE and supports all languages supported by Google with very good accuracy

CONS:
It currently can only listen if you PLAY YOUTUBE STREAM (NOT ALL STREAMS!) via ANDROID VLC PLAYER

For LOCAL VIDEOS on your STORAGE, you need ANDROID ES MEDIA PLAYER (by installing ES FILE EXPLORER) or FX MEDIA PLAYER (by installing FX FILE MANAGER)
